The Saint Bernard is exceedingly gentle despite its large size.<br>
Although this breed might have a bit of a stubborn nature,<br>
Saint Bernards are also patient, gentle, and sweet with small children,<br>
making them an excellent option for families with autistic children.<br>
These dogs are loyal and simple tasks are a breeze for them.<br>
Saint Bernards are well suited to work as therapy dogs,<br>
but due to their large size, it would be difficult for them<br>
to be service dogs full-time as they may<br>
unintentionally overpower a small child.

<h3 id="poodle">I am a beautiful dog Poodle!</h3>
<p><a href="#dogs_for_kids"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1652342516776-fcd4c54639c5?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80"></a></p>
Thanks to this breed’s keen intelligence, they can be taught<br>
to perform complex tasks when needed. These pint-sized pooches<br>
are smart and obedient to their owners. Poodles are also hypoallergenic,<br>
which makes them the perfect dog for families with members<br>
suffering from allergies. Due to their playful yet gentle ways,<br>
Poodles make for the ideal companions to autistic children.<br>
Empathetic by nature, poodles become attuned to their owners<br>
feelings and can sense negative emotions as they arise,<br>
making them the perfect emotional support dog.
